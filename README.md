📝 Project Overview

Sentiment Analysis System is an NLP-based web application that classifies user-provided text as Positive or Negative sentiment.
The system uses TF-IDF vectorization with a Logistic Regression model and is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud with automatic model training and loading.
